# Meta-Ad-Performance-Analysis
## Project Overview
This project presents an enhanced Meta Ad Performance Analysis Dashboard built using Power BI to evaluate advertising campaigns across Facebook and Instagram. The solution provides a full-funnel view from impressions to purchases, enriched with platform-specific business focus, insight-driven tooltips, and executive key insights to support data-driven marketing decisions.  

## Business Objective  
- **Cross-Platform Comparison:** Evaluate performance differences between Facebook and Instagram.  
- **Funnel Optimization:** Identify where users drop off between clicking an ad and making a purchase.  
- **Audience Profiling:** Pinpoint the most engaged demographics by age, gender, and geography.  
- **Creative Analysis:** Determine which ad formats (Video, Stories, Carousel, Image) yield the best ROI.  
- **Strategic Budgeting:** Analyze spend efficiency to maximize the $2.5M total budget.  

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)  
The dashboard tracks 12 critical metrics, including:   
- **Total Reach:** 339.8K Impressions.  
- **Engagement:** 46.1K Total Engagements (CTR: ~11.8%, Engagement Rate: ~13.6%).  
- **Conversion:** 2K Total Purchases with a 5.07% Conversion Rate (Clicks to Purchase).  
- **Financials:** $2.5M Total Budget with an average of $50.7K per campaign.  

## Tech Stack & Data Schema
- **Tool:**  Power BI (DAX, Power Query, Custom Tooltips).  
- **Data Source:**  Structured CSV files containing:  
  - **ad_events:** Event-level logs capturing user interactions such as Impressions, Clicks, Shares, Comments, and Purchases.    
  - **ads:** Metadata for platform and format (Carousel, Image, Stories, Video).    
  - **campaign:** Campaign strategy data covering budgets, start and end dates, and campaign timelines.  
  - **users:** Demographics (Age 18–50+), interests, and global locations.

## Key Insights
- **Facebook – Key Insights**  
• Stories ads deliver the highest conversion performance.  
• Users aged 22–30 show the strongest engagement levels.  
• High CTR does not always translate into purchases, indicating funnel drop-offs.  

- **Instagram – Key Insights**  
• Instagram Stories drive the highest engagement among ad formats.  
• Younger audiences (18–30) interact more with visual content.  
• Engagement is strong, but conversion completion requires retargeting strategies.  

## Dashboard Features & Tooltips
The dashboard utilizes advanced Power BI features like custom tooltips to provide deeper context:    
### 1. Platform-Specific Views 
- **Facebook Dashboard:** Focused on high-intent conversion tracking and hourly engagement trends.  
- **Instagram Dashboard:** Visualizes the "Discovery" phase, emphasizing visual storytelling and younger audience interactions.  

### 2. Deep-Dive Insights (Tooltips)
- **Conversion Insight:** Our tooltip analysis reveals that while CTR is strong, high engagement doesn't always equal sales. This suggests a "Curiosity Gap" where users interact but lack immediate buying intent.  
- **Engagement Insight:** Instagram generates superior engagement through visual storytelling, though users often remain in "discovery mode" longer than on Facebook.  

## Results
• Strong ad reach and engagement across Facebook and Instagram.  
• CTR is high, but conversions are comparatively lower, indicating funnel drop-offs.  
• Stories ads perform best across both platforms.  
• Facebook shows higher purchase intent.  
• Instagram drives strong engagement but needs retargeting to convert users.  
• Age group 18–30 is the most responsive audience segment.

## Conclusion
• This project demonstrates how Meta ad data can be transformed into actionable business insights through thoughtful dashboard design.  
• While engagement and visibility are strong across platforms, the analysis reveals conversion drop-offs at the lower funnel, highlighting the need for:  
- **Budget optimization on Facebook.**  
- **Retargeting strategies on Instagram.**
